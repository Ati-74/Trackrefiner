# TrackRefiner Algorithm’s Workflow

The flowcharts illustrating the workflow of the TrackRefiner algorithm are presented below. </br></br>
Standard flowchart conventions are employed, as follows:
- Oval (Terminator): Denotes the initiation or termination of the workflow.
- Rectangle (Process): Represents a specific step, action, or operation.
- Diamond (Decision): Indicates a decision point, typically associated with “Yes” or “No” outcomes.
- Parallelogram (Input/Output): Depicts data entry or output operations.
- Arrow: Connects elements and specifies the direction of process flow.

For enhanced clarity, color coding is applied so that <b>blue indicates correction processes</b> and <b>yellow denotes identification steps</b>.

## ML Model Training

To improve clarity, this section has been separated into two flowcharts. In the flowchart for the ML section called Classifier Training 1, there is a process labeled Train Classifier. The second flowchart, titled Classifier Training 2, presents this training process in greater detail. Since the procedure is
identical for all three classifiers and involves many steps, we created a separate flowchart to avoid
repetition and make both flowcharts easier to follow.
