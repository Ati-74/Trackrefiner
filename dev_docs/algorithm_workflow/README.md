# TrackRefiner Algorithm’s Workflow

The flowcharts illustrating the workflow of the TrackRefiner algorithm are presented below. </br></br>
Standard flowchart conventions are employed, as follows:
- Oval (Terminator): Denotes the initiation or termination of the workflow.
- Rectangle (Process): Represents a specific step, action, or operation.
- Diamond (Decision): Indicates a decision point, typically associated with “Yes” or “No” outcomes.
- Parallelogram (Input/Output): Depicts data entry or output operations.
- Arrow: Connects elements and specifies the direction of process flow.

For enhanced clarity, color coding is applied so that <b>blue indicates correction processes</b> and <b>yellow denotes identification steps</b>.
